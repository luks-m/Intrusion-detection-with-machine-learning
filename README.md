## Description
This project is a 2nd year engeneering school internship project at the University Of Qu√©bec in Outaouais.  
The purpose was to search and developp a program to code a neural network to learn time series in order to automate the sort of security alerts in a network.

## Report
You can access and read my final report in the folder `report`.

## Requirements
To install all required libraries, go to project root and run:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project

### Network logs classification
To execute the logs classification, go to `src/Intrusion-Detection-NSL-KDD/` folder.  
Then, use the command :
```bash
$ python3 attack_classification.py
```

### Text prediction
To execute the text prediction, go to `src/Word-Prediction` folder.   
Then, use this command to fit the model :
```bash
$ python3 text_precition.py
```
Then, use this command to test it :
```bash
$ python3 newt_word.py
```

### Learning finite state machine
To execute the text prediction, go to `src/Finite-State-Machine` folder.   
Then, use this command to fit the model :
```bash
$ python3 neural_network.py
```
Then, use this command to test it :
```bash
$ python3 test_prediction.py
```

### Cybersecurity automation
To execute the text prediction, go to `src/Final-Project` folder.   
Then, use this command to fit the model :
```bash
$ python3 lstm.py
```
